The ``estimateScore`` script is for creating and displaying league season tables from match results. It can be used for all kinds of sports, like football, floorball, etc. which are played seasonally. It is written as ``AngularJS`` script.

## Key features

### 1. Results Summary

The ``estimateScore`` will calculate the positions of the teams itself. You may update the results and view the table changed according to the modifications.
