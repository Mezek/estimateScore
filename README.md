estimateScore
-------------

The ``estimateScore`` script is for creating and displaying leage season tables from match results. It can be used for all kinds of sports, as football, floorball, etc. which are played seasonly. It is written as ``AngularJS`` script.

The ``estimateScore`` will calculate the positions of the teams itself. You may update the results and view the table changed according to the modifications.

As the main feature of the ``estimateScore`` is ``view the future results''. You can simulate the results of planned mathces for your favourite team and view the changes in the table immediately.

Some illustrations of the script capabilities you can see on the exhibiton [webpage]{https://mezek.github.io/estimateScore}.
