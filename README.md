The ``estimateScore`` script is for creating and displaying league season tables from match results. It can be used for all kinds of sports, like football, floorball, etc. which are played seasonally. It is written as ``AngularJS`` script.

The ``estimateScore`` will calculate the positions of the teams itself. You may update the results and view the table changed according to the modifications.

As the main feature of the ``estimateScore`` is ''view the future results''. You can simulate the results of planned matches for your favorite team and view the changes in the table immediately.

Some illustrations of the script capabilities you can see on the [exhibition webpage](https://mezek.github.io/estimateScore "EstimateScore webpage").
